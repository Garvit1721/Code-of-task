First of all I am not that much habitual of coding in python like I had IP in my class 12th but i didnt took it that seriously so I just know the basic of python programing but I am practicing to code in c++ and c and I have plan to learn python and datascience in depth duriny my summer vaccation

# LEARNING 
**Making HTTP Request**

So for me making http request with the help of c++ and c was quite difficult but I am wanted to join KOSS so I have no other option left to shift over other programing language. So I searched over internet which will help me to make http request easier and from there I got to know that we can import a library named **requests** .
